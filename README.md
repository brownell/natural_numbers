Natural Numbers
===============

This small Ruby app takes a file of comma-separated integers called 'numbers.txt' that is in the same folder.

It outputs the list of number and the smalles natural number (including zero) that is not in the input list of numbers.

It runs in time linearly proportional to the length of the input list.

To run the app, put numbers in numbers.txt and type 'ruby natural.rb'
